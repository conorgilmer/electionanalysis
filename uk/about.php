          <h2>About</h2>
          <p>Well I am a political(electoral system) geek, I love looking at elections in countries and seeing how they reflect what the people want etc. No system is perfect, and some good systems produce bad results and viceversa</ref>.
          <p>In the run up to the May 2015, General Election in the UK, i threw up these pages showing the polls, and the ratio of seats in the legislature to the votes a party got.</p>
	<p>The UK for Westminister elections uses the <strong>First past the post (FPTP)</strong> system, which favours the larger parties, and often excludes minor parties from the parliament, and minimises the third party..</p>

	<p>It always amazed me how in the UK with only 40% or even less one of the main parties can have a massive majority in parliament, yet say the greens with a few percentage get nothing, or liberals with 15% get less than 10% of the seats.</p>
