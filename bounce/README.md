Seat Bounce
===========
Seat Bounce or Bonus is the additional seats a party gets in parliament relative to its first preference vote.

## PR-STV - Proportional Representation - Single Transferable Vote
Seat bounce tends to be how transfer appealing a party or its candidates are , and how it positions numbers of candidates in constituencies and how many of them, to maximise the seat return.

## FPTP - First Past the Post
In a way the traditional voting method, is often the least proportional. A national percentage vote, can deliver a low or now seats, where a much lower percentage of the vote, concentrated in a certain area can deliver a large number of seats relative to the percentage of the vote, e.g. the SNP in the recent UK national elections, or UKIP and the Liberal democrats not turning their vote share into seats.

## AV - Alternative Vote
Use in Australia, and anumber of other juristicions, and defeated in a Referendum in the UK. Is another attempt at providing a proportional system of voting.
