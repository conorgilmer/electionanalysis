          <h2>About</h2>
          <p>Well I am a political(electoral system) geek, I love looking at elections in countries and seeing how they reflect what the people want etc. No system is perfect, and some good systems produce bad results and viceversa</ref>.
          <p>Here I look at Irish general elections which use Proportional Representation - Single Transferrable Vote(PR-STV).</p>
	<p>I have grouped together Sinn Fein(1918/1921), Anti-Treaty-SF, Republicans and Fianna Fail</p>
	<p>I have grouped together Pro-Treaty-SF, Cumann na nGaedheal and Fine Gael</p>
	<p>I have aslo grouped together Offical SF, SFWP and WP, as well as Abstentionist SF, PSF, HBlock and Sinn Fein</p>
	<p>Unionists I have kept, but perhaps I could interpret independents and map them with the Irish Unionists, such as the Trinity College TD up until 1937.</p>
