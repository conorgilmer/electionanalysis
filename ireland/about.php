          <p>Well I am a political(electoral system) geek, I love looking at elections in countries and seeing how they reflect what the people want etc. No system is perfect, and some good systems produce bad results and viceversa</ref>.
          <p>Ireland uses Single Transferrable Vote - Proportional Representation (STV-PR) for all election, twice referendums where defeated to change the voting system to a first past the post system.<p>
	<p>For time to time alternatives such as list systems and Alternative Vote(AV) have been suggested as possible more proportional systems, or ones which would reduce the parochial nature of politics.</p>
